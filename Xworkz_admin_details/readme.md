1. Configuration Files
WebConfiguration
Purpose: Configures the Spring MVC framework.

Annotations:

@Configuration: Marks the class as a configuration class for Spring.
@ComponentScan("com.xworkz"): Scans the package com.xworkz for components, controllers, services, and repositories.
@EnableWebMvc: Enables Spring's Web MVC features.
Constructor: Prints a message when the class is instantiated, showing that the configuration is loaded.

WebInitialization
Purpose: Initializes the DispatcherServlet and maps it to URLs.
Class Extensions:
AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer: Simplifies DispatcherServlet initialization with Spring configurations.
WebMvcConfigurer: Provides callback methods to customize Spring MVC configurations.
Key Methods:
getRootConfigClasses(): Defines root application context classes, typically for non-web beans. Returns an empty array here.
getServletConfigClasses(): Defines the configuration for DispatcherServlet, specifying WebConfiguration.
getServletMappings(): Maps / as the default URL for the servlet.
configureDefaultServletHandling(): Enables serving static resources by delegating to the default servlet.
Flow: When the application starts, WebInitialization sets up WebConfiguration and maps it to handle all requests (/). This initializes Spring's DispatcherServlet.

2. Controller
AdmindetailsController
Purpose: Handles HTTP requests.

Annotations:

@Controller: Marks the class as a controller.
@RequestMapping("/"): Maps the root URL to this controller.
Dependencies:

AdmindetailsService: Injected using @Autowired to delegate service logic.
Method:

onSubmit(AdmindetailsDTO dto): Handles POST requests for /save.
Prints the DTO received from the form.
Calls the service layer to save the DTO.
Returns success.jsp if the save operation succeeds, else form.jsp.
Flow: When a user submits the form, the DTO is passed to onSubmit. It validates the data and saves it using the service layer. The appropriate JSP page is returned based on the success of the operation.

3. DTO
AdmindetailsDTO
Purpose: Data Transfer Object for capturing user input.

Annotations:

@Data (Lombok): Generates getters, setters, and other utility methods.
@NoArgsConstructor (Lombok): Generates a no-argument constructor.
Fields:

Represents user details like id, name, age, etc.
Flow: The AdmindetailsDTO is populated automatically when form data is submitted to the controller.

4. Entity
AdmindetailsEntity
Purpose: Represents a database table.

Annotations:

@Entity: Marks the class as a JPA entity.
@Table(name = "admin_details_table"): Maps the class to the admin_details_table in the database.
@Id: Marks the primary key.
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY): Auto-generates the primary key.
@Column: Maps fields to specific columns in the table.
Fields:

Matches the structure of the database table.
Flow: The AdmindetailsEntity is used to persist data into the database.

5. Repository
AdmindetailsRepository and AdmindetailsRepositoryImpl
Purpose: Handles database operations.
Interface:
AdmindetailsRepository: Defines the contract for saving entities.
Implementation:
AdmindetailsRepositoryImpl: Implements the save operation using JPA.
Uses EntityManager for database interactions.
Handles transactions explicitly with EntityTransaction.
Flow: The repository layer abstracts database operations, allowing the service layer to focus on business logic.

6. Service
AdmindetailsService and AdmindetailsServiceImpl
Purpose: Encapsulates business logic.
Interface:
AdmindetailsService: Defines the contract for saving DTOs.
Implementation:
AdmindetailsServiceImpl: Implements validation and entity conversion logic.
Validates fields like name length, age, password strength, etc.
Converts the DTO to an entity and saves it using the repository.
Flow: The service layer ensures data integrity by validating inputs before persisting them into the database.

7. Persistence Configuration
persistence.xml
Purpose: Configures JPA for database access.
Key Elements:
<persistence-unit>: Defines a JPA unit with the name xworkz.
<provider>: Specifies Hibernate as the JPA provider.
<properties>: Configures database connection properties like URL, driver, username, and password.
Flow: When the repository tries to persist an entity, JPA uses the settings in persistence.xml to establish a database connection.

Flow of Execution
Initialization:

WebInitialization sets up the WebConfiguration.
Spring initializes the DispatcherServlet to handle web requests.
Request Handling:

User submits a form to /save.
AdmindetailsController processes the request and delegates validation and saving to the service layer.
Business Logic:

AdmindetailsServiceImpl validates the DTO.
Converts the DTO to AdmindetailsEntity.
Persistence:

AdmindetailsRepositoryImpl saves the entity using JPA.
Hibernate maps the entity to the admin_details_table in the database.
Response:

Controller returns a JSP view (success.jsp or form.jsp) based on the outcome.
Why Each Part Exists
Configuration: Sets up the Spring environment.
Controller: Handles user interactions and delegates logic to the service.
DTO: Transfers data between layers.
Entity: Represents database structure.
Repository: Handles database logic.
Service: Encapsulates validation and business rules.
Persistence: Configures JPA to interact with the database.
This modular architecture separates concerns, ensuring maintainability and scalability.


Below is a textual description of the flowchart, followed by steps to generate it visually:

Flowchart Steps
Start: User opens the web application.
Form Display: User navigates to the form page.
The form is displayed using form.jsp.
Form Submission: User fills out the form and submits it.
HTTP POST request is sent to /save.
Controller (AdmindetailsController):
Receives the DTO populated with form data.
Calls the AdmindetailsService to process the data.
Service (AdmindetailsServiceImpl):
Validates the DTO.
If validation fails:
Returns form.jsp for corrections.
If validation passes:
Converts the DTO into an entity.
Calls AdmindetailsRepository to save the entity.
Repository (AdmindetailsRepositoryImpl):
Creates a database connection using JPA.
Saves the entity in the admin_details_table.
Closes the connection.
Success or Failure:
If the save is successful:
Controller returns success.jsp.
If the save fails:
Controller returns form.jsp with an error message.
End: The user is redirected to the appropriate JSP page.
